# Pedestrian-Detection System
## Description:
A pedestrian detection system built on YOLOv8 leverages state of the art deep learning to accurately identify and localize people in real time. 
The system processes video frames efficiently, generating bounding boxes around pedestrians to support reliable decision-making and enhance overall safety.
## Working:
The enhanced pedestrian detection system processes input video footage and generates an output video with bounding boxes around each pedestrian. 
This functionality enables accurate identification of pedestrians in street environments, thereby improving safety and situational awareness.
## Example:
let us take an input video:
